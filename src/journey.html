            EXO offers a modern, safe, and luxurious industry-leading approach to interplanetary travel. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to our integration of the revolutionary <strong>Murphy Accelerator</strong>, you can now reach even 
            the most distant destinations, like <a href="" class="font-bold underline text-red-400">Europa</a>, 
            in just two months. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the immense energy and maintenance required to cross such vast distances so quickly, EXO only 
            offers one-way trips. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For those who prefer to bypass the journey altogether, our <strong>Extended Sleep Modules</strong> are 
            available at a reduced charge, ensuring that passengers feel as though they've arrived in the blink 
            of an eye, waking up ready to begin their adventure.

			<p>
				Thanks to our integration of the revolutionary <strong>Murphy Accelerator</strong>, you can now reach even
				the most distant destinations, like <a href="" class="font-bold underline text-red-400">Europa</a>,
				in just two months.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the immense energy and maintenance required to cross such vast distances so quickly, EXO only
				offers one-way trips.
			</p>
			<p>
				For those who prefer to bypass the journey altogether, our <strong>Extended Sleep Modules</strong> are
				available at a reduced charge, ensuring that passengers feel as though they've arrived in the blink
				of an eye, waking up ready to begin their adventure.
